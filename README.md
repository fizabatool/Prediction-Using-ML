# Prediction-Using-ML
This repository consists of some of my personal data science projects which include predictions using diffrent ML algorithms. Here's what i have learned.

1) Using keras for designing neural network layers
2) K-means for understanding trends in data and adding clusters for better predictions.
3) Implementing and fine tuning ML MODELS like XGBoost, SVM, random forest etc.
4) EDA to understand the data better, using python libraries.
